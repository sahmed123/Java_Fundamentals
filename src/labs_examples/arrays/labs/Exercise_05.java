/**
 *  Traversing Arrays Backwards
 *
 *      Please create and populate an array of your choosing. Then, please demonstrate how to print out every other
 *      element in the array in reverse order.
 *
 *      My Method
 *      Create an array of whatever type and then run through a for loop with a limit set for the # of elements
 *      Printing in reverse order can be done by traversing from end to the start
 *      Every other element means that you need to track whether the last element was printed or not
 *      Use a boolean lastPrinted value to flip between yes and no till you iterate through the entire array
